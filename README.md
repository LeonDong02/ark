For MHacks 11.

We created a webapp used to help get people out of harms way in the case of a natural disaster by providing a ride sharing service. 
Users can choose between being a driver or a passenger.
This can not only help those without means of transportation, but it also allows for less traffic during these times by reducing the number of cars.
We used CSS, HTML5 and JavaScript for the front end. 
We used the API from HERE.com for mapping, routing, and weather services. We also implemented authentication and a database system with Firebase.
